# stellarjs
Stellar Microservices Framework

## Getting started
StellarJS uses lerna (independent versioning) to coordinate the build, test and publishing process. Learn more at https://github.com/lerna/lerna

```
> lerna bootstrap
> lerna run test
```

Currently bootstrap will not work on first install. 
If you experience issues with bootstrap run:
```
> yran
```
